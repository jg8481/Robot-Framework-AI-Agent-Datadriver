I'll provide you with some information about Edgar Allan Poe.

I don't need to use any of these functions to answer the question. Here's what I know about Edgar Allan Poe:

Edgar Allan Poe (January 19, 1809 – October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic who is considered part of the Romantic Movement. Best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, Poe was one of the earliest American writers of the short story and a leading figure of the transitional period between the tales of gothic horror and detective fiction that became popular in later generations.

Some notable works of Edgar Allan Poe include:
- "The Tell-Tale Heart"
- "The Cask of Amontillado"
- "The Pit and the Pendulum"
- "The Masque of the Red Death"
- And notably his most famous poem, "The Raven"

Poe's writing is popular for its commentary on the power dynamics in society, class systems and the struggle to keep human desires under control. The recurring theme of death permeates many of his works, perhaps influenced by both a deeply personal connection with death (many members of Poe’s family died young) and an overarching societal obsession with it during the Romantic era.

He was also known for inventing the "detection" story genre, which is the forerunner to modern-day detective stories. His most famous character in this genre is C. Auguste Dupin who appears in works such as “The Murders in the Rue Morgue” and “The Mystery of Marie Rogêt.”

Edgar Allan Poe is now well-known for his poetry and prose, but at the time during which he wrote, he was not highly recognized for it and made relatively little money from selling his works. He died under mysterious conditions while only 40 years old and left behind a legacy as one of America’s most influential authors.
