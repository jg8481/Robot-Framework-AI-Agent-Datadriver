# Security Audit and Remediation Report: saas-starter

**Date:** 2025-04-27
**Project:** `/root/workspace/ai-agent-input/data-files/saas-starter`
**Auditor:** Goose AI Agent

## 1. Summary

A security audit was performed on the `saas-starter` Next.js project. The audit included dependency vulnerability scanning and manual code review focusing on common web application security risks.

Several potential issues were identified, primarily related to a hardcoded default password in the database seeding script and documentation. Appropriate fixes were implemented to mitigate these risks.

## 2. Audit Process

1.  **Dependency Scanning:** Used `pnpm audit` to check for known vulnerabilities in project dependencies.
2.  **Static Code Analysis:** Manually reviewed the codebase using `rg` (ripgrep) to search for:
    *   Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens)
    *   Insecure handling of authentication and authorization
    *   Potential injection vulnerabilities
    *   Insecure configuration
    *   Sensitive information leakage

## 3. Findings and Remediation

### 3.1. Dependency Vulnerabilities

*   **Finding:** No known vulnerabilities were found in the project dependencies via `pnpm audit`.
*   **Status:** Resolved (No action needed).

### 3.2. Hardcoded Default Password

*   **Finding:** A default password (`admin123`) was hardcoded in the database seeding script (`lib/db/seed.ts`) and mentioned in the `README.md`.
*   **Risk:** High. Using default credentials is a major security risk, allowing easy unauthorized access, especially if deployed.
*   **Remediation:**
    *   Modified `lib/db/seed.ts` to replace the hardcoded password with a placeholder (`REPLACE_WITH_SECURE_PASSWORD`) and added a warning comment emphasizing the need for secure password generation or prompting during setup.
    *   Updated `README.md` to remove the specific default password and advise users to ensure a secure password is set, referencing the seed script.
*   **Status:** Resolved.

### 3.3. Secret Management (Environment Variables)

*   **Finding:** Sensitive information (Stripe keys, AUTH_SECRET) is correctly managed using environment variables (`.env` file).
*   **Risk:** Low (Good practice observed).
*   **Remediation:** Verified that `.env` is included in the `.gitignore` file to prevent accidental commits of secrets.
*   **Status:** Verified.

### 3.4. Password Hashing

*   **Finding:** The application uses `bcryptjs` for password hashing (`lib/auth/session.ts`), which is a secure standard.
*   **Risk:** Low (Good practice observed).
*   **Status:** Verified.

### 3.5. Authentication and Session Management

*   **Finding:** JWTs are used for session management, signed with a secret stored in an environment variable (`AUTH_SECRET`). Middleware protects routes.
*   **Risk:** Low (Standard practice observed).
*   **Status:** Verified.

### 3.6. Input Validation

*   **Finding:** Zod is used for schema validation in server actions (`app/(login)/actions.ts`), providing protection against invalid data.
*   **Risk:** Low (Good practice observed).
*   **Status:** Verified.

### 3.7. Stripe Webhook Security

*   **Finding:** Stripe webhooks are verified using a `webhookSecret` stored as an environment variable.
*   **Risk:** Low (Essential security measure implemented).
*   **Status:** Verified.

## 4. Recommendations

*   **Environment Configuration:** Strictly enforce the separation of configuration secrets using environment variables. Ensure `.env` files are never committed to version control.
*   **Seed Script:** Implement a robust mechanism in the `db:seed` script for the initial administrator password, either by prompting the user or generating a secure random password and displaying it once.
*   **Regular Audits:** Conduct periodic security audits, especially after introducing new features or updating dependencies.
*   **Static Analysis Tools:** Consider integrating automated static application security testing (SAST) tools into the CI/CD pipeline for continuous security analysis.

## 5. Conclusion

The `saas-starter` project demonstrates good security practices in several areas, including dependency management, secret handling, and input validation. The primary vulnerability identified (hardcoded default password) has been addressed. By following the recommendations, the security posture of the application can be further strengthened.
