# Summary of OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet

This document summarizes the key recommendations from the OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet for implementing secure password reset functionality.

## Introduction & Core Principles

Implementing a "Forgot Password" feature is essential for user management but introduces security risks if not done carefully. Common vulnerabilities include user enumeration.

**Key Guidelines:**

*   **Consistent Messaging:** Always return the same generic message whether an account exists or not.
*   **Uniform Timing:** Ensure response times are consistent for both valid and invalid requests to prevent timing attacks used for user enumeration.
*   **Side-Channel Communication:** Use a separate communication channel (like email or SMS) to deliver the password reset instructions or token.
*   **Secure Tokens/Codes:**
    *   Use URL tokens for simplicity.
    *   Generate tokens/codes using a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSRNG).
    *   Make them sufficiently long to resist brute-force attacks.
    *   Store them securely (e.g., hashed) like passwords.
    *   Ensure they are single-use and expire after a reasonable period (e.g., 15-60 minutes).
*   **No Premature Account Changes:** Do not alter the account state (e.g., locking it) until the user successfully presents a valid token/code.

## Password Reset Process Steps

### 1. Forgot Password Request Phase

When a user initiates a password reset (e.g., by providing an email or username):

*   Adhere to the consistent messaging and uniform timing principles mentioned above.
*   Implement anti-automation controls (e.g., rate limiting per account, CAPTCHA) to prevent attackers from flooding users' inboxes/SMS with reset requests.
*   Apply standard web security practices like input validation and SQL injection prevention.

### 2. User Resets Password Phase

After the user proves their identity (e.g., by clicking a link with a token or entering a code):

*   **Password Confirmation:** Require the user to enter their new password twice.
*   **Password Policy:** Enforce the same secure password policy used during registration/password changes.
*   **Secure Storage:** Update and store the new password securely (e.g., hashed and salted).
*   **Notification:** Send the user a confirmation email stating their password *has been* reset (do **not** include the new password).
*   **No Auto-Login:** Require the user to log in normally with their new password; do not log them in automatically after the reset.
*   **Session Invalidation:** Offer to invalidate all other active sessions for the user, or do so automatically.

## Methods for Identity Verification

Several methods can be used (and potentially combined) to verify the user during a password reset:

*   **URL Tokens:** (Most Common)
    *   Generate a long, random, single-use token.
    *   Embed it in a URL (`https://.../?token=...`) sent via email.
    *   **Security:** Use HTTPS, avoid relying on the `Host` header (prevent Host Header Injection), set `Referrer-Policy: noreferrer` on the reset page, rate-limit token submission attempts.
*   **PINs:**
    *   Generate a short numeric code (6-12 digits).
    *   Send via a side-channel (e.g., SMS).
    *   User enters PIN (and potentially username) on the reset page.
    *   Create a temporary, limited session allowing only password reset.
*   **Offline Methods:**
    *   Use pre-shared secrets (e.g., recovery codes provided at registration) stored securely by the user offline.
    *   Backend still validates the submitted code.
    *   Examples include hardware OTP tokens or certificates (often for enterprise or higher security needs).
*   **Security Questions:**
    *   **Strongly discouraged** as the *sole* method due to easily guessable/discoverable answers.
    *   Can be used as an *additional* layer of verification if questions are robust and answers stored securely.

## General Security Practices for Identifiers (Tokens/PINs)

*   **Randomness:** Use a CSRNG. JWTs can be an alternative but add complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Length:** Sufficient to prevent brute-force guessing.
*   **User Association:** Link the identifier to the specific user account initiating the request.
*   **Single Use:** Invalidate immediately after successful use.
*   **Expiration:** Implement a reasonably short expiry time.
*   **Secure Storage:** Store hashes of tokens/codes in the database, similar to passwords.

## Account Lockout

**Do not** lock user accounts as a response to failed password reset attempts. This creates a Denial of Service vulnerability where an attacker can lock out legitimate users simply by knowing their username/email and initiating failed resets. Handle excessive attempts via rate limiting or CAPTCHAs instead.
