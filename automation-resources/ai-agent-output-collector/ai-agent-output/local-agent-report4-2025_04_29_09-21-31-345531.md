To answer your questions accurately, I need to first identify the specific geographic area you're asking about. Based on historical and current weather data, one location known for extremely high temperatures is Death Valley, California, USA. It holds the record for being the hottest place on Earth with a recorded surface temperature of 56.7°C (134°F) in 1913.

Given this information:

- **Location:** Death Valley, CA, USA

Now I'll proceed to answer each question one by one based on this location.

### What are 3 examples of animals that live in Death Valley?
Some key species include:
1. Joshua tree ant
2. Desert tortoise
3. Bighorn sheep

### Are those animals endangered?
- The Joshua tree ant is not considered a concern for extinction but its habitat, the Joshua tree forest itself, is threatened due to climate change.
- **Desert Tortoise**: Listed as Vulnerable by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) primarily because of habitat loss, poaching, and disease.
- **Bighorn Sheep** in general have recovering populations after conservation efforts but some subspecies like those in southern California including Death Valley National Park are still listed under endangered statuses due to a range of threats.

### What is the nearest river to that location?
The nearest major water body to Death Valley would be the **Amargosa River**, which does not meet the definition of a “river” often, as it is usually flowing underground. It can sometimes appear above ground within certain portions of its basin and near Beatty in Death Valley Park, NV.
