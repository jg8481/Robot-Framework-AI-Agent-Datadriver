Here are the answers to your questions:
- The hottest spot on Earth currently measured by scientists is the Dasht-e Lut desert in Iran. However, the unofficial record holder for highest temperature goes to Furnace Creek in Death Valley, California.
- Three animal examples that can be found there include: 
  - Desert tortoise (Gopherus agassizii)
  - Sidewinder snake (Crotalus cerastes)
  - Bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis nelsoni)
- Of those listed above:
  * The desert tortoise is considered vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and is protected under US law as a threatened species.
  * The sidewinder snake is not currently endangered.
  * The bighorn sheep in that region are stable enough to be classified as "least concern" but other subspecies of bighorn sheep are critically endangered. 
- The Death Valley area near Furnace Creek is over 100 miles from the nearest river, which is the Colorado River.

Let me know if you need more details on any part!
