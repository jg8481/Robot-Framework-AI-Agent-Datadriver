- The location on Earth that typically experiences the highest temperatures is the deserts of the Middle East, notably the Lut Desert in Iran. It has recorded some of the world's highest land surface temperatures.
  
- Examples of animals living in such extreme environments include:
  - Sand cats
  - Fennec foxes
  - Deathstalker scorpions

- The status regarding endangerment varies for these species:
  - Sand cats are classified as Near Threatened due to habitat loss and degradation.
  - Fennec foxes are considered Least Concern but face threats from hunting, trade, and loss of habitat.
  - Deathstalker scorpions are not endangered but are a concern for human safety due to their venom.

- One nearby river is the Karkheh River which flows near the southern edge of Iran. It's an important water resource in that region but would not be directly adjacent to the Lut Desert (the hottest spot). The nearest major river would likely depend more specifically on the particular area within the desert considered, and may be small seasonal streams rather than large rivers.

I hope this answers your questions sufficiently!
