# Summary of OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet

This document summarizes the key recommendations from the OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet for implementing secure password reset functionality.

## Introduction & General Guidelines

*   **Problem:** Forgot password features, while necessary, are common vulnerability points (e.g., user enumeration).
*   **Key Quick Guidelines:**
    *   Use consistent messages and response times for valid/invalid accounts to prevent enumeration.
    *   Use a side-channel (like email or SMS) for reset instructions/tokens.
    *   URL tokens are often the simplest method.
    *   Generated tokens/codes must be:
        *   Random (cryptographically secure).
        *   Sufficiently long (to prevent brute-force).
        *   Stored securely (hashed).
        *   Single-use and expire after a reasonable time.
    *   Do not change account state (like locking) until the token is validated.
*   **Scope:** Focuses on password reset, not MFA reset (refer to MFA Cheat Sheet for that).

## Forgot Password Service Steps

The process involves two main steps:

### 1. Forgot Password Request

*   **Input:** User provides username or email.
*   **Security Measures:**
    *   **Consistent Response:** Return the *exact same message* (e.g., "If an account exists for this user, a password reset link has been sent.") regardless of whether the user exists.
    *   **Consistent Timing:** Ensure the time taken to respond is uniform to prevent timing-based enumeration attacks. Use asynchronous calls or ensure identical logic paths.
    *   **Rate Limiting/CAPTCHA:** Protect against automated floods of requests per account (to prevent DoS on the user's email/SMS).
    *   **Standard Protections:** Apply input validation and SQL injection prevention.

### 2. User Resets Password

*   **Input:** User provides the received token/code and sets a new password.
*   **Security Measures:**
    *   **Password Confirmation:** Require the user to enter the new password twice.
    *   **Password Policy:** Enforce the application's standard secure password policy.
    *   **Secure Storage:** Store the new password securely (hashed, salted - see Password Storage Cheat Sheet).
    *   **Notification:** Email the user *after* the password has been successfully reset (do not include the new password).
    *   **Login:** Require the user to log in normally with the new password; do *not* automatically log them in after reset.
    *   **Session Invalidation:** Ask the user if they want to invalidate all other active sessions, or do it automatically.

## Methods for Resetting Passwords

Methods rely on identifying the user or contacting them via a side-channel.

### General Security Practices for Identifiers (Tokens/Codes/PINs)

*   **Generation:** Use a cryptographically secure random number generator (CSPRNG). JWTs are possible but add complexity and potential vulnerabilities.
*   **Length:** Must be long enough to resist brute-force attacks.
*   **Binding:** Link the identifier to the specific user account in the database.
*   **Usage:** Must be single-use (invalidated immediately after successful use).
*   **Storage:** Store securely (e.g., hashed) in the database.
*   **Expiry:** Must expire after a short, appropriate period (e.g., 15-60 minutes).

### Method: URL Tokens (Commonly via Email)

1.  **Generate & Send:** Create a unique, random token, embed it in a URL query string, and email it to the user.
    *   **URL Safety:** Do *not* rely on the `Host` header to build the URL (prevents Host Header Injection). Hardcode or validate against an allowlist of domains. Use HTTPS.
2.  **User Clicks Link:** The user accesses the URL.
    *   **Referrer Policy:** Set `Referrer-Policy: noreferrer` on the reset page to prevent token leakage via the Referrer header.
    *   **Brute-Force Protection:** Implement rate limiting on token validation attempts.
3.  **Optional Validation:** Can add steps like security questions.
4.  **Set New Password:** User provides and confirms the new password.

### Method: PINs (Commonly via SMS)

1.  **Generate & Send:** Create a numeric PIN (6-12 digits) and send via SMS (breaking it up with spaces aids usability).
2.  **User Enters PIN:** User inputs the PIN and their username on the reset page.
3.  **Limited Session:** Validate the PIN and create a *temporary, restricted session* that *only* allows password reset.
4.  **Set New Password:** User provides and confirms the new password.

### Method: Offline Methods

*   **Concept:** User employs a pre-obtained identifier (e.g., recovery codes, hardware token, certificate) provided during registration or setup, stored securely offline (like a password manager).
*   **Backend Role:** Still requires backend authentication/validation of the provided identifier.
*   **Scope:** Hardware tokens, certificates, enterprise solutions are out of scope for this sheet. MFA recovery codes are covered in the MFA cheat sheet.

### Method: Security Questions

*   **Weakness:** Should **never** be the *sole* method for reset, as answers are often easily guessable or discoverable (OSINT).
*   **Use Case:** Can be an *additional* layer of security combined with other methods (e.g., after clicking a URL token).
*   **Implementation:** Must use strong, non-obvious questions (see Security Questions Cheat Sheet).

## Account Lockout

*   **Recommendation:** **Do not** lock out accounts based on failed *forgot password attempts*.
*   **Reason:** This creates a Denial of Service vulnerability where an attacker can lock out legitimate users by repeatedly triggering the forgot password flow for known usernames.
*   **Refer:** See Authentication Cheat Sheet for login-related lockout guidance.
