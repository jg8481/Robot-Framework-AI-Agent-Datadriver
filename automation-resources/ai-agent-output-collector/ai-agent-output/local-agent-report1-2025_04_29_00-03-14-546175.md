I don't need to use any tools to answer this question. Here's a brief biography of Edgar Allan Poe:

Edgar Allan Poe (1809-1849) was an American writer, poet, editor, and critic. He is best known for his tales of mystery and the macabre, including famous works like "The Raven," "The Tell-Tale Heart," and "The Fall of the House of Usher." Poe's poetry had a profound influence on subsequent poets and authors who specialize in dark romanticism or gothic literature.

Some key points about Poe:

- He was born in Boston, Massachusetts, but moved to Virginia as an infant after his parents' death.
- Adopted by John Allan, a merchant in Richmond, VA, though this family relationship ended acrimoniously in adulthood.
- Served in the U.S. Army for two years and attended West Point Military Academy before beginning his literary career seriously.
- Contributed to periodicals including the "Southern Literary Messenger" where he worked as an editor and critic.
- Poe's work influenced fellow authors such as Baudelaire, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and Vladimir Nabokov significantly.

Edgar Allan Poe died under mysterious circumstances in Baltimore on October 7th, 1849 at age 40. His life story has been the subject of various books and interpretations over time due to many unanswered questions about its details.
