The hottest place on Earth, where the highest temperatures have been recorded, is the desert region known as "Dasht-e Lut" or Lut Desert in Iran. This area often experiences surface temperatures reaching above 70°C (158°F) during the summer months.

Three examples of animals that inhabit this extreme environment include:
1. The Death Stalker Scorpion (Androctonus crassicauda)
2. Dorcus beetles
3. Fennec Foxes, which are more commonly found in nearby regions but can be seen as an example of a desert-adapted mammal.

These animals have unique adaptations that allow them to survive in such harsh conditions. Notably, the Death Stalker Scorpion is not endangered due to its wide distribution and adaptability, though it primarily avoids human settlements for safety reasons. Dorcus beetles also are not critically endangered as they have a broad habitat range within deserts. Fennec Foxes on the other hand are listed as Least Concern by IUCN but their populations can be threatened locally based on specific factors such as habitat loss and hunting pressures.

The nearest major river to this area is the Helmand River, which flows into neighboring areas of Iran and Afghanistan far from the hottest regions, but no large rivers flow directly near Lut Desert due to its remote and arid nature. Therefore, the wildlife there must rely on subterranean water sources or sporadic desert streams when available.

Here's answering your questions sequentially:
- Earth's location with highest temperature: Dasht-e Lut in Iran.
- Animals that live there: Death Stalker Scorpion, Dorcus beetle, and Fennec Fox (proximity).
- Endangered status of these animals (as noted for the most relevant): Not critically endangered among mentioned species. 
- Nearest river: The Helmand River but it's very distant from the location with highest temperature since no rivers flow nearby Dasht-e Lut due to its aridity and geographical isolation.

For precise conservation statuses, specific local conditions should be verified.
