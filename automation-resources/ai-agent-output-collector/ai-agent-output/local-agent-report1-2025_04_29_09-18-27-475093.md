I don't need to use any of the provided functions to answer this question. Here's a brief biography about Edgar Allan Poe:

Edgar Allan Poe (born January 19, 1809 â€“ died October 7, 1849) was an American writer, editor, and literary critic who is widely regarded as one of the most influential figures in both American literature and English-language literature. He was born in Boston, Massachusetts to actors David Poe Jr. and Elizabeth Arnold Hopkins. By the age of three, his parents had died due to tuberculosis, leaving him orphaned.

He was then taken in by John Allan, a wealthy tobacco merchant who lived near where he and Edgar's foster mother resided in Richmond, Virginia. The surname "Allan" as well as the middle name "Allan," are likely because Poe would have been part of the household with Mr. Allan as his stepfather.

Poe is best known for his poetry, short stories, and literary criticism. He was one of the first writers to try making a living from literature. His famous works include poems like "The Raven" (1845), and tales such as "The Tell-Tale Heart" (1843) and "The Cask of Amontillado" (1846). 

He is also known for his mysterious death which remains a topic of speculation among literary scholars. Poe's writing had a significant influence on the development of mystery, detective novels, psychological horror, science fiction and gothic genres.
