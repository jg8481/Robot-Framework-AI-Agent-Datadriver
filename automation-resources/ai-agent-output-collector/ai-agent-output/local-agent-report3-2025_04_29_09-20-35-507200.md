The OWASP Top Ten Project provides a powerful awareness document for developers, managers, and technical decision-makers. Here's an overview of the current version (2017) along with advice on how to apply this knowledge in your work:

### OWASP Top 10 Overview

#### A1: Injection
- **Description**: Unvalidated input leading to unintended actions being performed by a system.
- **Action Plan**: Implement proper validation and sanitization of all inputs. Use prepared statements or parameterized queries.

#### A2: Broken Authentication
- **Description**: Weaknesses arise in the mechanisms for authenticating users, managing sessions, maintaining state across requests, and preventing abuse of this state information.
- **Action Plan**: Utilize proven libraries for password authentication that implement industry best practices such as multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### A3: Sensitive Data Exposure
- **Description**: Inadequate protection of sensitive data like passwords or credit card numbers during transmission or storage.
- **Action Plan**: Use HTTPS and properly configure secure protocols, keys, and certificates. Encrypt sensitive information both at rest and in transit.

#### A4: XML External Entities (XXE)
- **Description**: Poor handling of untrusted XML inputs causing unauthorized access to internal resources or the execution of code on servers processing these inputs.
- **Action Plan**: Disable DTDs when parsing untrusted XML data and validate XML schemas strictly.

#### A5: Broken Access Control
- **Description**: Lack of enforcement for protecting against unauthorized access.
- **Action Plan**: Apply strict permission management principles and always design features considering least privilege rules.

#### A6: Security Misconfiguration
- **Description**: Failure to apply security best practices during application configuration or leaving the system in insecure, default configurations before deploying applications into production environments.
- **Action Plan**: Regularly audit your environment for misconfigurations and follow strict change management processes.

#### A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Description**: Insertion of user-supplied data in web pages viewed by other users without proper validation, which may then run unauthorized code in their browsers.
- **Action Plan**: Use context-sensitive output encoding techniques to sanitize potentially malicious content before rendering it on the client side.

#### A8: Insecure Deserialization
- **Description**: Processing serialized objects from untrusted sources results in non-restricted object creation leading to command execution.
- **Action Plan**: Disable features that allow script invocation through deserialization mechanisms. Implement strict validation and input sanitization rules for incoming data.

#### A9: Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
- **Description**: Utilizing outdated components prone to injection flaws, cross-site scripting issues, buffer overflows, or similar concerns.
- **Action Plan**: Keep your software stacks up-to-date; monitor trusted security advisories from vendors/developers.

#### A10: Insufficient Logging & Monitoring
- **Description**: Failing to detect events that could signal the occurrence of a security breach in time due to insufficient logging or inadequate operational monitoring practices.
- **Action Plan**: Maintain comprehensive logging and error handling strategies with timely review capabilities. Ensure logs are secure from alteration/deletion attempts by unauthorized parties.

### Applying Knowledge Across Your Team
1. **Educate Team Members**: Organize training sessions for developers and operations staff. Share detailed documentation provided by OWASP.
2. **Implement Security Practices**: Enforce coding standards that align with the principles outlined in the Top Ten Guidelines across all projects.
3. **Regular Audits & Reviews**: Conduct periodic code reviews and application assessments looking specifically at adherence to these best practices.

### Additional Resources
- **OWASP Wiki**: Detailed articles on various topics within web app security are available here - https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)**: Offers a comprehensive approach to managing organizational cybersecurity risks. Use its guidelines alongside OWASP for holistic protection strategies.
- **Web Application Security Consortium (WASC)**: Provides research efforts into web application security issues and best practices - http://projects.webappsec.org/

This should give you a strong starting point in applying and disseminating knowledge about common vulnerabilities to your team while encouraging continuous learning and improvement.
